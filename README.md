# eventObserver
The purpose of this class is to watch for clicks on anchor tags inside a specified container, load the linked resource and update the display. This is the default behaviour; however, it's possible to customise the event watched for and how the class responds; probably not all that usefull - I got carried away!

The inspiration for this was to create a menu system like Github - an admin portal could be loaded and updated without refreshing the page every time. I noticed Github used Pjax. Pjax appears to be far more complex then this version; although this version meets my needs (ignoring the unecessary extras ðŸ˜²). 

When a loaded resource includes a script; it is extracted and dymnamically loaded via 'import(...)'; attempts to copy it into the <head> worked but required extra managment to remove / check for in when the user moves away from and back to a given page.

There is a degree of sanitisation for loaded resources, but since its designed for my own purpose its unlikely I'll add malicious code; however, it's a fun exercie!
